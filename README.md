# License Plate Recognition Dataset
Dataset offers **58 229** images of vehicles featuring license plates from the USA, making it an excellent resource for tasks involving **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition), **license plate identification**, and **vehicle registration** data extraction. Each image is accompanied by a CSV file that provides the corresponding plate text and country code, ideal for developing and testing text recognition systems.

With this dataset, researchers and developers can build and refine solutions for **traffic analysis**, **transportation management**, and autonomous **vehicle technologies**. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/belgium-license-plate-detection-dataset/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=belgium-license-plate-dataset)**

The dataset includes a CSV file mapping image file names to corresponding plate text and country labels. Photos represent various road types, road segments, and traffic scenarios, offering a diverse foundation for training and processing OCR systems.
